# clojodlee

A Clojure library designed to play nice with Yodlee's API. 

## Setup

```
(defproject foo "0.1.0"
  ...
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.9.x"]
                 [cljodlee "0.1.0"]]
  ...)
```

## Usage

For when you or your brethren would like to integrate with Yodlee, but then you found their API & Docs to be a pain in the ass to work with.

Hopefully this library will make it easier for you.


### What's up with the name - clojodlee

the mangled mashing of the words of `clojure`+ `yodlee`.  Some say this is not right in the ways of the world, or is even trying to be _cute_. I assure, no puppies were harmed in the creation of this library or its namesake.
